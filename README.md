# War Game
This is turn based strategy game I made inspired by a board game I played with my A-level physics class. The basic aim of the game is to capture all your opponents cities.
The game ends when there is only one player who is in control of a city. One goes about doing this by recruiting units and capturing land (which can be used to recruit 
more units).
